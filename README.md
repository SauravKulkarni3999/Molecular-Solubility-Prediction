# Molecular Solubility Prediction
# Molecular Solubility Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains notebooks and code for predicting the solubility of molecular compounds using machine learning models. The project aims to analyze molecular structures and provide accurate solubility predictions based on molecular features.

The main components of the project include:
- **Molecular_Solubility_Prediction.ipynb**: A notebook dedicated to building and evaluating machine learning models for molecular solubility prediction.
- **Molecular_Solubility_Prediction_Feature_Importance.ipynb**: A notebook focused on analyzing the feature importance of the molecular descriptors used in the solubility prediction model.

## Requirements

The project requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- RDKit (for molecular descriptor generation)

Install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
